![MCPH Demo](https://mcph.io/assets/demo.gif)

MCPH is an AI artifact storage and sharing system that lets you package your AI-generated content in crates. It provides permanent storage for your artifacts and auto-expiry for guest uploads. It works with ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Features at a Glance

- **Context Engineering Hub**: Store your AI context like company style guides and brand voice as separate artifacts
- **Persistent Artifact Storage**: Never lose an AI-generated artifact again with powerful organization and retrieval
- **Seamless Share Links**: Share your AI artifacts with a single, universal link that works for both humans and AI systems
- **Multi-Agent Relay**: All AI tools‚ÄîClaude, ChatGPT, Gemini‚Äîcan write and access the same artifacts
- **Native MCP Integration**: Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard for direct integration with AI systems
- **Multiple Content Types**: Store and share markdown, code, images, JSON, YAML, text, and binary files
- **Security Features**: Private by default with optional password protection, 30-day expiration for anonymous uploads (authenticated users' crates have no expiration)
- **Enhanced Content Preview**: Better visualization and interaction with different content types
- **Feedback Collection System**: Create custom feedback templates with various field types (text, rating, select, etc.) to collect structured feedback on your projects

## Quick Start

- **MCP Endpoint:** `https://mcp.mcph.io/mcp`
- **Web UI:** [mcph.io](https://mcph.io)
- **Crate Page:** `https://mcph.io/crate/[id]`

### Getting Started with MCPH

1. **Create an Account**: Visit [mcph.io](https://mcph.io) and sign up for a free account. After logging in, navigate to the API Keys section to generate your personal API key.

2. **Connect Your AI Tool**: MCPH works with any AI tool that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Configure your tool with:
   - MCP URL: `https://mcp.mcph.io/mcp`
   - Your API Key (from your MCPH account dashboard)

3. **Create and Share Content**: Once connected, you can ask your AI to create and share content via MCPH. For example:
   ```
   "Create a markdown guide explaining user authentication best practices and share it via MCPH."
   ```
   The AI will create the content and provide you with a shareable link that looks like: `https://mcph.io/crate/abc123`

## üöÄ 6 Power Use Cases for MCPH

### 1. Persistent AI Memory System üß†

Transform AI into a learning partner that remembers everything across sessions. Build a searchable knowledge base that grows smarter over time.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Upload project contexts**: "Save our coding standards as a crate"
2. **Tag systematically**: `project:webapp`, `type:guidelines`, `team:frontend`
3. **Search & retrieve**: "Find our React component patterns"
4. **AI remembers**: "Apply our coding standards to this new component"

**Real Example:** Store your API error handling patterns once, and every AI session can reference them: "How do we handle auth errors in our system?"

### 2. Living Documentation That Updates Itself üìö

Documentation that evolves with your code. When you change features, AI updates all related docs automatically.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create base docs**: README, API specs, architecture diagrams
2. **Link with tags**: `doc:api-v2`, `component:auth`, `version:latest`
3. **Update cascade**: "Update all auth documentation after this refactor"
4. **AI maintains consistency** across all docs

**Real Example:** Change your database schema ‚Üí AI updates ERD diagrams, migration guides, and API docs in connected crates.

### 3. Multi-Agent Project Pipeline ü§ù

Different AI specialists working together on your project, each handling what they do best.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Claude (Architect)**: Creates system design ‚Üí saves to crate
2. **ChatGPT (Developer)**: Reads design ‚Üí implements code ‚Üí saves to crate
3. **Gemini (Tester)**: Reads both ‚Üí writes test suite ‚Üí saves to crate

For anonymous users:

- **Anonymous uploads** are available through AI assistants that support MCP
- **30-day expiration** - your content will be automatically deleted after 30 days
- **Limited management** - you can't search, organize, or manage your files
- **No MCP all tools access** - you can only use the crates_get tool to get a crate by its ID. You cannot use the other tools.

## Development

### Running the Application

The project consists of two separate services:

```bash
# Run the Next.js frontend
npm run dev

# Run the MCP server (from the mcp directory)
cd mcp && npm run dev
# Or using the helper script from the root directory
npm run dev:mcp
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the Next.js frontend
npm run build

# Build the MCP server (from the mcp directory)
cd mcp && npm run build
# Or using the helper script from the root directory
npm run build:mcp
```

### Connect with mcp-remote

```sh
npx mcp-remote https://mcp.mcph.io/mcp
```

Or configure your client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCPH": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.mcph.io/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

MCPH supports two authentication methods:

1. **OAuth (Recommended)**: Sign in with your MCPH account through the OAuth flow
2. **API Key**: Pass your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header

For AI assistants using custom integrations (like Claude AI), OAuth provides the easiest setup experience.

## How the MCP Endpoint Works

The **MCP endpoint** (`https://mcp.mcph.io/mcp`) is the only supported way to interact with MCPH programmatically. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) over Streamable HTTP for real-time, bidirectional communication.

1. **Connect via Streamable HTTP:** Use `npx mcp-remote https://mcp.mcph.io/mcp` or configure your client to use the endpoint.
2. **Authentication:** Pass your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
3. **Session:** On connect, you receive a session ID in the `MCP-Session-ID` response header. All subsequent requests must include this ID in the `MCP-Session-ID` header.
4. **Calling Tools:** Send JSON-RPC requests to the endpoint. Example for `crates/list`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "crates/list",
    "arguments": {}
  }
}
```

The response will be streamed using Streamable HTTP, with content delivered as chunks in the HTTP response.

For more details, see the [mcp-remote documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) or the [MCP protocol reference](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/mcp).
