## Development

### Running the Application

The project consists of two separate services:

```bash
# Run the Next.js frontend
npm run dev

# Run the MCP server (from the mcp directory)
cd mcp && npm run dev
# Or using the helper script from the root directory
npm run dev:mcp
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the Next.js frontend
npm run build

# Build the MCP server (from the mcp directory)
cd mcp && npm run build
# Or using the helper script from the root directory
npm run build:mcp
```

### Connect with mcp-remote

```sh
npx mcp-remote https://api.mcph.io/mcp
```

Or configure your client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCPH": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://api.mcph.io/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

MCPH supports two authentication methods:

## How the MCP Endpoint Works

The **MCP endpoint** (`https://api.mcph.io/mcp`) is the only supported way to interact with MCPH programmatically. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) over Streamable HTTP for real-time, bidirectional communication.

1. **Connect via Streamable HTTP:** Use `npx mcp-remote https://api.mcph.io/mcp` or configure your client to use the endpoint.
2. **Authentication:** Pass your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
3. **Session:** On connect, you receive a session ID in the `MCP-Session-ID` response header. All subsequent requests must include this ID in the `MCP-Session-ID` header.
4. **Calling Tools:** Send JSON-RPC requests to the endpoint. Example for `crates/list`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "crates/list",
    "arguments": {}
  }
}
```

The response will be streamed using Streamable HTTP, with content delivered as chunks in the HTTP response.

For more details, see the [mcp-remote documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) or the [MCP protocol reference](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/mcp).
