This is a placeholder file. You need to record a real GIF demonstration showing how to integrate Cr8 with Claude in under 60 seconds. 

The final GIF should:
- Be 4MB or less
- Load in under 2 seconds on broadband
- Auto-scale width on mobile devices
- Clearly demonstrate the 3-step process:
  1. Copy configuration
  2. Paste into Claude settings
  3. Reload Claude

After recording, replace this file with your actual GIF.
