# Security Policy

## Overview

MCPH (Model Context Protocol Hub) takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policy, vulnerability reporting process, and commitment to addressing security issues in a timely manner.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Vulnerability Reporting Process

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in MCPH, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Do NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it

### Preferred Reporting Method

Please send security vulnerability reports to: **security@mcph.io**

Include the following information in your report:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity assessment
- Any suggested remediation steps
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Alternative Reporting Methods

If email is not available, you can:

1. Create a private security advisory on GitHub
2. Contact the maintainers directly through encrypted channels

## Response Timeline

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities within **30 days** of disclosure:

- **Within 24 hours**: Acknowledge receipt of your report
- **Within 7 days**: Provide initial assessment and severity classification
- **Within 30 days**: Release a fix or provide a detailed remediation plan

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- OAuth 2.0 with Dynamic Client Registration
- API key-based authentication for MCP tools
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Proper access control for shared content

### Data Protection

- All data transmission uses HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt
- Secure handling of authentication tokens
- Input validation and sanitization

### Infrastructure Security

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request timeout protection
- CORS configuration for web security
- Security headers via Helmet.js
- Structured logging for security monitoring

### Content Security

- Content-Type validation for uploads
- File size limits to prevent abuse
- Automatic content expiration for anonymous uploads
- Secure signed URLs for file access

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

- Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly
- Use HTTPS for all MCP server communications
- Implement proper error handling in your applications
- Validate all user inputs before sending to MCPH

### For Content Sharing

- Use password protection for sensitive content
- Review sharing permissions before making content public
- Regularly audit your shared content
- Remove expired or unnecessary shared items

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

- Anonymous uploads are public by default
- Content-based scanning is limited
- User-generated content is not automatically moderated

### Planned Security Enhancements

- Content security scanning
- Enhanced audit logging
- Advanced threat detection
- Multi-factor authentication support

## Security Updates

### Notification Process

Security updates will be communicated through:

1. GitHub Security Advisories
2. Release notes with security tags
3. Email notifications to registered users (if applicable)
4. Documentation updates

### Update Recommendations

- Monitor our GitHub repository for security updates
- Subscribe to release notifications
- Update to the latest version promptly when security fixes are available
- Review our changelog for security-related changes

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards

MCPH follows industry-standard security practices:

- OWASP Web Application Security guidelines
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications
- Google Cloud Platform security best practices
- Firebase security recommendations

### Regular Security Reviews

We conduct regular security assessments including:

- Code reviews with security focus
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure security audits
- Penetration testing (when applicable)

## Incident Response

### In Case of a Security Incident

If we discover or are informed of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
2. **Containment**: Take immediate steps to prevent further exposure
3. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and affected systems
4. **Communication**: Notify affected users within 72 hours
5. **Remediation**: Implement fixes and strengthen defenses
6. **Follow-up**: Provide detailed incident report and prevention measures

### User Notification

In the event of a data breach or security incident affecting user data:

- We will notify affected users within 72 hours
- Notification will include impact assessment and recommended actions
- Updates will be provided as the investigation progresses

## Contact Information

### Security Team

- **Primary Contact**: security@mcph.io
- **GitHub Security**: Create a private security advisory
- **Emergency Contact**: Available through GitHub issue escalation

### Maintainers

- Project maintainers can be reached through GitHub issues for non-security matters
- For urgent security matters, use the security contact methods above

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community's efforts to improve our security. Researchers who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities will be:

- Credited in our security advisories (with their permission)
- Listed in our hall of fame (if they wish)
- Provided with updates on fix progress

## Legal

### Responsible Disclosure

We support responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- Do not access or modify user data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability

### Safe Harbor

This security policy constitutes our safe harbor for security researchers acting in good faith under the terms described above.
